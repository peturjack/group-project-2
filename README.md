# group-project-1#
First group project; creating a single-page website using Figma, HTML, and CSS.
This webpage is a landing page for a record label named Lagaffe Tales. The landing page displays a background video, Lagaffe logo with a hovering effect, navigation bar, and social media links.

We used Miro and Slack to organise our project, communicate and manage the group. We used VS Code and GitHub to write the HTML and CSS. We used Miro to create a moodboard and then created the prototype in Figma.

The group worked very well together and taught each other many new things. One of the biggest challenged was creating a video background as well as a hover effect to the logo.
