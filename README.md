# group-project-2#
Second group project; create an Interactive Web Application using fundamental web technologies and the tools provided by the Design Thinking ideology.
Our project is redesigning an already made website, to make it user friendly and easier to navigate. The page is a library for elementary school, full of games, books, test and more, that teacher and students from first to tenth grade use.
We made a user story and made the pages needed to go through the story.

Design thinking week; on the Empathy stage we did research to see what/where the problem might be and get insight. Using FigJam to collect our findings. Next we defined the needs and made a problem statement. During the Ideation stage we tried crazy 8 to come up with ideas.

We used FigJam for Design thinking and Miro to have and overview and organise our project.
Using Figma for wireframe, design and prototype, using VS code to  write HTML/CSS/Javascript. Each member coded their own pages and components then used branches to push them to GitHub to collect our pages.

The group worked very well together and taught each other many new things. One of the biggest challenged was figuring out Javascript.
We came together as a group for most of the decisions and helped each other when needed.
